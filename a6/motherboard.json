        "details": "Realtek 8118 LAN is a high performance and friendly network chip for gaming players with automatic bandwidth allocation to ensure the highest network priority of the game or application. It can provide users the most comprehensive features and the fastest and smoothest Internet experience. GIGABYTE Motherboards are focused on delivering M.2 technology to enthusiasts who want to maximize their systemâ€™s potential. Enjoy true HD display capability using the most commonly integrated digital output technologies on todayâ€™s HD displays and TVs. With Smart Fan, 5 users can ensure that their gaming PC can maintain its performance while staying cool. Smart Fan 5 allows users to interchange their fan headers to reflect different thermal sensors at different locations on the motherboard. Not only that, with Smart Fan, but 5 more hybrid fan headers that support both PWM and Voltage mode fans have also been introduced to make the motherboard more liquid cooling friendly. Achieve fan silence. With Fan Stop, map any fan to stop completely when temperatures drop below a specified threshold. Which fan stops, based on readings from which sensor, and at what temperatureâ€”all of it can be customized to your liking. GIGABYTE motherboards use high-end audio capacitors. These high-quality capacitors help deliver high resolution and high fidelity audio to provide the most realistic sound effects for gamers. GIGABYTE motherboards feature an audio noise guard that essentially separates the boardâ€™s sensitive analog audio components from potential noise pollution at the PCB level. Sulfur compounds in the air can penetrate tiny onboard resistors creating chemical change and causing these resistors to open or short. If either of these occurs the motherboard will fail to function. By equipping resistors with an Anti-Sulfur Design GIGABYTE gives Ultra Durable Motherboards a whole new meaning. GIGABYTE motherboards also feature special anti-surge IC that protect your motherboard, helping to ensure that your PC is equipped to deal with any potentially irregular electrical spikes. There is nothing more harmful to the longevity of your PC than moisture, and most parts of the world experience moisture in the air as humidity at some point during the year. GIGABYTE motherboards have been designed to make sure that humidity is never an issue, incorporating a new Glass Fabric PCB technology that repels moisture caused by humid and damp conditions. Glass Fabric PCB technology uses a new PCB material which reduces the amount of space between the fiber weave, making it much more difficult for moisture to penetrate compared to traditional motherboard PCBs. This offers much better protection from short circuits and system malfunction caused by humid and damp conditions. GIGABYTE motherboards use Low RDS(on) MOSFETs which reduce energy wastage through unnecessary residual heat dissipation. This all amounts to tangible energy savings which are beneficial for both end-users and the environment without impacting system performance. The BIOS is essential for users during the initial setup to allow for the most optimal settings. With a new GUI and easier to use functionalities, GIGABYTE has been able to reinvent the BIOS to give users a better experience while setting up their new system."

        "title": "GIGABYTE H410M H V3 10th Gen Micro ATX Motherboard",
        "details": "The GIGABYTE H410M H V3 10th & Gen Micro ATX Motherboard is made for Intel 10th and Generation processors. The GIGABYTE H410M H V3 Gen Motherboard has two DIMM RAM slots available which can support Bus Speeds of up to 2933MHz. The motherboard supports HDMI and D-Sub graphical output ports and can display two displays at once. The GIGABYTE motherboard also comes with 8-Channel HD Audio with High-Quality Audio Capacitors which provides crystal clear sound all around. The mother also provides you with NVMe PCIe Gen3 x4 2280 M.2 Connector, Intel GbE LAN with cFosSpeed Internet Accelerator Software, and more. Intel GbE LAN features cFosSpeed, a network traffic management application that helps to improve network latency and maintain low ping times to deliver better responsiveness in crowded LAN environments.GIGABYTE Motherboards are focused on delivering M.2 technology to enthusiasts who want to maximize their systemâ€™s potential.With Smart Fan, 5 users can ensure that their gaming PC can maintain its performance while staying cool. Smart Fan 5 allows users to interchange their fan headers to reflect different thermal sensors at different locations on the motherboard. Not only that, with Smart Fan, 5 more hybrid fan headers that support both PWM and Voltage mode fans have been introduced to make the motherboard more liquid cooling friendly. Achieve fan silence. With Fan Stop, map any fan to stop completely when temperatures drop below a specified threshold. Which fan stops, based on readings from which sensor, and at what temperature, all of it can be customized to your liking. GIGABYTE motherboards use high-end audio capacitors. These high-quality capacitors help deliver high resolution and high fidelity audio to provide the most realistic sound effects for gamers. GIGABYTE motherboards feature an audio noise guard that essentially separates the boardâ€™s sensitive analog audio components from potential noise pollution at the PCB level.Sulfur compounds in the air can penetrate tiny onboard resistors creating chemical change and causing these resistors to open or short. If either of these occurs the motherboard will fail to function. By equipping resistors with an Anti-Sulfur Design GIGABYTE gives Ultra Durable Motherboards a whole new meaning. GIGABYTE motherboards also feature special anti-surge IC that protect your motherboard, helping to ensure that your PC is equipped to deal with any potentially irregular electrical spikes. There is nothing more harmful to the longevity of your PC than moisture, and most parts of the world experience moisture in the air as humidity at some point during the year. GIGABYTE motherboards have been designed to make sure that humidity is never an issue, incorporating a new Glass Fabric PCB technology that repels moisture caused by humid and damp conditions. Glass Fabric PCB technology uses a new PCB material that reduces the amount of space between the fiber weave, making it much more difficult for moisture to penetrate compared to traditional motherboard PCBs. This offers much better protection from short circuits and system malfunction caused by humid and damp conditions. GIGABYTE motherboards use Low RDS(on) MOSFETs which reduce energy wastage through unnecessary residual heat dissipation. This all amounts to tangible energy savings which are beneficial for both end-users and the environment without impacting system performance. The BIOS is essential for users during initial setup to allow for the most optimal settings. With a new GUI and easier-to-use functionalities, GIGABYTE has been able to reinvent the BIOS to give users a better experience while setting up their new system."

        "details": "Realtek 8118 LAN is a high performance and friendly network chip for gaming players with automatic bandwidth allocation to ensure the highest network priority of the game or application. It can provide users the most comprehensive features and the fastest and smoothest Internet experience. GIGABYTE Motherboards are focused on delivering M.2 technology to enthusiasts who want to maximize their systemâ€™s potential. With Smart Fan, 5 users can ensure that their gaming PC can maintain its performance while staying cool. Smart Fan 5 allows users to interchange their fan headers to reflect different thermal sensors at different locations on the motherboard. Not only that, with Smart Fan, but 5 more hybrid fan headers that support both PWM and Voltage mode fans have also been introduced to make the motherboard more liquid cooling friendly. Achieve fan silence. With Fan Stop, map any fan to stop completely when temperatures drop below a specified threshold. Which fan stops, based on readings from which sensor, and at what temperatureâ€”all of it can be customized to your liking. GIGABYTE motherboards use high-end audio capacitors. These high-quality capacitors help deliver high resolution and high fidelity audio to provide the most realistic sound effects for gamers. GIGABYTE motherboards feature an audio noise guard that essentially separates the boardâ€™s sensitive analog audio components from potential noise pollution at the PCB level. Sulfur compounds in the air can penetrate tiny onboard resistors creating chemical change and causing these resistors to open or short. If either of these occurs the motherboard will fail to function. By equipping resistors with an Anti-Sulfur Design GIGABYTE gives Ultra Durable Motherboards a whole new meaning. GIGABYTE motherboards also feature special anti-surge IC that protect your motherboard, helping to ensure that your PC is equipped to deal with any potentially irregular electrical spikes. There is nothing more harmful to the longevity of your PC than moisture, and most parts of the world experience moisture in the air as humidity at some point during the year. GIGABYTE motherboards have been designed to make sure that humidity is never an issue, incorporating a new Glass Fabric PCB technology that repels moisture caused by humid and damp conditions. Glass Fabric PCB technology uses a new PCB material which reduces the amount of space between the fiber weave, making it much more difficult for moisture to penetrate compared to traditional motherboard PCBs. This offers much better protection from short circuits and system malfunction caused by humid and damp conditions. GIGABYTE motherboards use Low RDS(on) MOSFETs which reduce energy wastage through unnecessary residual heat dissipation. This all amounts to tangible energy savings which are beneficial for both end-users and the environment without impacting system performance. The BIOS is essential for users during the initial setup to allow for the most optimal settings. With a new GUI and easier to use functionalities, GIGABYTE has been able to reinvent the BIOS to give users a better experience while setting up their new system."
