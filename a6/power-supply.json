The 80 PLUS Bronze efficiency rating, DC-to-DC + LLC circuit design, single +12V rail, active PFC, and temperature sensitive HDB fan offer a power supply unit that stays true to its original purpose. This PSU will handle all your core computing needs with none of the hassles or challenges of additional specialty features, software synchronization, or other bells and whistles. Just plug it into your system and get to work. For a great mid-tier computing experience, you can't go wrong with the MWE Bronze V2.It's important to understand what efficiency is and what the ratings actually mean. The efficiency rating indicates how much power is retained and/or lost when transferring it from the wall to your components. It does not indicate the overall quality of the PSU. A PSU doesn't need an 80 PLUS Gold rating to be safe and reliable. And a PSU with an 80 PLUS Gold rating isn't necessarily either of those things. The MWE Bronze V2 guarantees a typical efficiency of 85% while being both safe and reliable.The constant struggle between cooling and noise is as old as the consumer PC industry itself. Keeping your components cool without having to hear about it while you work is still one of the greatest challenges for all fan based cooling technologies. The MWE Bronze's solution to this problem is a thermally sensitive 120mm HDB fan. It spins based on the system's temperature, constantly adjusting to keep your PSU running smoothly and safely with the minimum amount of noise required.Getting power from the wall to the PSU and then to your components is a tricky situation. The power comes in one voltage level, but your components need a different one. That power has to first be transferred to/through a converter in order to make it safe for your parts to use without overloading. The lines/rails used to initially move power from the wall to the converter need to be reliable and consistent to ensure your system's overall performance. That's why the MWE Bronze only uses one +12V rail for this process. This way all the components in your system are constantly fed the same power from the same source in order to guarantee consistency between all connections.Power comes in multiple voltage levels. The wall delivers power in one voltage level but your components each need a specific voltage to operate properly. The process of converting raw power from the wall to the multiple voltage levels your components need requires special components to complete this process quickly, efficiently, and safely. The MWE Bronze's DC-to-DC + LLC technology was painstakingly crafted to accomplish this goal. The Dual Forward circuit layout has been designed to convert 12V power to 3V and 5V levels with minimal ripple noise, 80 PLUS Bronze efficiency, and reduced risk to your connected components.For many PC Builders with aesthetics in mind, cabling can be one of the most troublesome parts of assembling a PC. Cables can be confusing, too short or too long, and they almost never look good. The MWE Bronze - V2 uses flat and flexible black cables to help deal with these problems. These cables are more discrete and flexible, making them easier to implement into your system while taking up less space. This is especially useful for smaller cases and preserving airflow."}]},{"images":"https://www.startech.com.bd/image/cache/catalog/power-supply/montech/beta-550/beta-550-01-500x500.webp","name":"Montech Beta 550 550W 80 Plus Bronze Certified Power Supply","Price":"4,500৳","Regular Price":"4,980৳","Status":"In Stock","Product Code":"27567","Brand":"Montech","keyFeatures":["Model: Beta 550","Continues Power: 550W","ATX Version: ATX12V","Fan Size: 120mm","Efficiency Rating: 80 Plus Bronze"],"specification":[{"name":"Key Features","details":[{"key":"Continuous Power","value":"500W"},{"key":"Efficiency (Approx.)","value":"83% Typically"},{"key":"Certification","value":"80 Plus Bronze"},{"key":"Fan Size","value":"120mm"},{"key":"Lighting Effect","value":"N/A"},{"key":"Others","value":"Protections: OVP / OPP / UVP / SCP"}]},{"name":"Input","details":[{"key":"Voltage","value":"100-240Vac"},{"key":"Frequency Range","value":"47Hz to 63Hz"},{"key":"Current","value":"8A"}]},{"name":"Output","details":[{"key":"Modular Type","value":"Non-modular"},{"key":"Total Power","value":"500W"},{"key":"Peak Power","value":"500W"},{"key":"AC Input","value":"100-240Vac 47-63Hz 8.0A"},{"key":"DC Output","value":"+3.3V\n+5V\n12V\n-12V\n+5VSB"}]},{"name":"Connector","details":[{"key":"Main Power","value":"500W"},{"key":"PCI-E","value":"2"},{"key":"SATA","value":"SATA Connector: 6"},{"key":"Molex","value":"Molex Connector: 2"}]},{"name":"Warranty Information","details":[{"key":"Manufacturing Warranty","value":"03 Years"}]}],"description":[{"title":"Montech Beta 550 550W 80 Plus Bronze Certified Power SupplyBuy Montech Beta 550 550W 80 Plus Bronze Certified Power Supply from the best Power Supply Shop in BD","details":"The Montech Beta 550 Bronze is a 550W power supply that has been certified with 80 PLUS Bronze efficiency.
